<h2>Professional reflection</h2>
<p>I have done a lot in my life already. I have had one great love. I raised two typical,
mediocre children. I have spent entirely too much time already in classes. Yet, I have
repeatedly chosen careers which require regular professional development!</p>
<p>
I tried out a lot of jobs before gaining some semblance of what I might want to do
permanently. I tried food service in both a gas station and briefly a fast food restaurant. I
worked customer service in a clothing store, bookstores, and gas stations. I have
assembled repair kits and been a call center representative, secret shopper, tour guide,
office assistant, and personal care worker!</p>
<p>
I have spent the most time working in elementary schools, in various positions, over
nearly a decade and a half. While none were quite what I wanted to do permanently,
this exploration helped cement the knowledge that I wanted to work in an elementary
school.</p>
<p>
I currently serve as an exam proctor and election inspector and intend to do so until I
graduate and transition to a full-time career in a school library. I eagerly await the
opportunity to manage a school library and make the space my own. I want to make
sure the library I work in honors the diversity of its community and reflects the diversity
and wonder of the world.</p>
<h2>Teaching philosophy</h2>
<p>
All learning is social learning. Learning occurs when the individual combines ideas,
emotions, and motivations from others in her world and talks to herself using the
language of others. Small group learning happens when we respond within a discourse
and within those contexts that we create as a group. The small group is what mediates
between the individual and the community. In communities of practice we gradually
adopt the communityâ€™s ways of thinking and doing and in small ways change and add
to the community through our participation. The things we think come from our
interactions with others and influence and shape our individual thinking. Everything we
think about, every consideration we make, is somehow influenced by others: our
family, culture, and friends as well as subtle and overt influences of society.
