<h2>Owen Reissmann</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome to my professional space. I am glad you are here.</p>
<p>I will very soon complete the final year of study. These years of hard work and discovery will have earned me a masters degree in Library and Information Science and Wisconsin state certification as a Teacher Librarian in May, 2023. </p>
<p>I have developed this professional website with the purpose of highlighting some of my accomplishments along that journey. Visitors will be able to explore content I have created as a student and thus get to know a bit about me and how I think. Current library staff looking for a mentee can judge if I might be a good fit for the wisdom they have to impart. Potential employers can see a bit of what I could bring to their organization.</p>
