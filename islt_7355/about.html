    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I earned my undergraduate degree from the University of Wisconsin: Stevens Point in 2016. In order to bolster my professional skills, before, during, and after pursuing my bachelor of arts, I obtained <em>certificates</em> in Communications, Global/Multicultural Economics, and Business Administration as well as an Office Assistant technical <em>diploma</em> from Northcentral Technical College. In December, 2022, I will complete a masters degree in library and information science from the University of Missouri: Colombia. In May, 2023, I will obtain Wisconsin state certification as a <strong>Teacher Librarian</strong>. </p> 
    <p>I love language. I speak Spanish and English. I enjoy reading in both languages. I would like to travel the world and discover how the libraries of the modern digital world operate in various places, perhaps helping to connect and share ideas among libraries across the globe.</p>
    <h2>Words that move me</h2>
