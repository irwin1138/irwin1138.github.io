              <a id="Artifact1"> <h3>  
Professional position description and performance appraisal
  </h3></a>
<h4>
  Goal 2: To provide students with the evaluative and analytical
skills to respond flexibly and adaptably to future changes and challenges
within the organizations and institutions where they will be employed.
SLO 2: Graduates will apply management principles and interdisciplinary
best practices in library and information agency environments.
  </h4>
  <p>
For my Management of Information Agencies course, one of the projects I had to complete
was a professional position description such as I might need to in order to fill a job opening once I
become library manager. The second portion of the project was to compile a set of questions to be part
of a performance appraisal for the position. This task served as a demonstration of my understanding of
the many requirements of various positions within information agencies as well as common reporting
structures and organizational hierarchies. I had to think about exactly which skills would be required for
the specific position and what specific questions would best serve to measure the employee’s
performance of those skills.
  </p>

<p>  
This course thoroughly analyzed reporting structures, organizational hierarchies, and
management styles. Because my interest is mainly in being a school librarian, this portion of the activity
did not allow me the opportunity to display much of all I had learned on the subject of reporting
structures and organizational hierarchies. It was an interesting challenge to be the one creating a
performance appraisal rather than receiving one and having to craft questions that would target specific
skills required of the position.

<h4>
  Goal 3: To provide students with opportunities to develop
cutting-edge technological skills and competences used across the
information professions.
SLO 3: Graduates will be competent in information organization and
lifecycle activities techniques of organization of information and with using
and evaluating technologies of the information professions.
  </h4>
<p>
  For my Organization of Information course, I had to work with a group of classmates to
thoroughly explore and analyze an assigned integrated library system product. The intention of this
project was to get a more complete idea of all that is involved in the systems libraries implement,
troubleshoot, and work with on a daily basis. We had to come together as a group to break down the
various elements we needed to cover in order to complete all of the requirements. Next, we each
undertook our individual tasks and compiled our research into sections of the essay. Then, we came
together again to discuss where certain aspects overlapped, proofread each other’s sections, and decide
on the best way to combine them into a coherent report.
  </p>
 <a href="Artifact2.pdf">"Artifact 2"</a>
<p>
  This project provided me with what felt like an authentic experience similar to something I
might need to undertake as a member of a library staff or which I might need to complete entirely on my
own should I be employed in a school library. I learned how group members’ individual skills and
interests can complement each other well. Each member of the group found something within the
assignment requirements that they felt particularly drawn to or qualified to do, which made distribution
of tasks easy.
  </p>
              <a id="Artifact3">   <h3>Reading Promotion Proposal</h3> </a>
<h4>
  Goal 4: To develop an appreciation of the service-based and
user-focused nature of the information professions.
SLO 4: Graduates will be able to assess community needs, formulate plans
to respond to users of information agencies, and instruct users in using
  informational resources.
  </h4>
<p>
  In my School Library Administration course, the culminating project was to create a proposal
for a new library program. This allowed me to envision and create a program I would like to implement in
a future school library position. I had to prepare a lengthy report detailing everything that would be
involved in bringing the new library program to fruition. This included staffing requirements, volunteer
work needed, cost of materials and other financial investments, resources required, spaces used, and
any collaboration or support that would need to be sought. The intention would be for this report to be
submitted to the principal, other decision-making staff members, and members of the school board.
  </p>
  <a href="Artifact3.pdf">"Artifact 3"</a>
  <p>
    This project allowed me to be creative and really think about some of the things I might like
to pursue once I become a library manager. I fleshed out a few ideas, considering whether each would
present a reasonable request, would generate interest from staff, school board members, the
community, and students themselves, and would be within an acceptable budget.
