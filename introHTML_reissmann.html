    My name is Owen. I am 37 years old. My favorite color is silver. My favorite foods are potato, taro, yuca, yam, and plantain. My favorite meals are Beef Wellington, xiao long bao, and tempura vegetables.
    I have no previous web application or development training or experience.
    The most I have done is a bit of formatting while modding games of Werewolf.
    I expect to struggle with this course but hopefully develop a basic understanding of coding.
    I do not expect to do much of anything with my newly-learned web development skills except perhaps feel slightly less bewildered when confronted with small children who can code far better than I can.
    My favorite hobbies include disc golf, inline skating, language, food, and board games.
    I am sorry. What is meant by the phrase “free time?” I am not familiar with such a concept.
