                <h3>About the Course</h3>
            <p>Welcome to World Geography where we will attempt to see Earth from a different perspective. Not through the lens of country and citizenship but from a geographic one that shows us how similar we really are.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to teach you the 7 major regions of the world, help you learn some tools of geography, and understand how the history of the planet still impacts you to this day. With this website, you have some basic objectives, like learning what geography is and how it impacts you. You will also have some deeper objectives like learning how ancient civilizations settled, what the history of a place does to shape its population, and how culture is directly tied to things like geographic borders. The goal of the course is to help you understand how the history of the Earth can be looked at through the geographic features of our pale, blue dot.</p>
